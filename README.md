# Quote in your status bar

This is a simple plugin for Obsidian that adds a quote to your status bar. It's a bit like the "Quote of the day" plugin, but it's not just a random quote. 

It's a quote just for you. It's a quote that makes you move forward, that inspires you, that makes you think, that makes you feel good. It's a quote that you can read every day, and it will always be relevant to you.

# How to use this plugin

1. Just install it
2. It will add a quote to your status bar. _Default quote is my one_ :)
3. You can change the quote for yourself in **plugin setting tab**.
